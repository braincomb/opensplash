Wireless Captive Portal for FreeBSD (defunct)

OpenSplash (http://www.opensplash.org) is now an outdated and defunct project which I have written in 2003.
It was the first Wireless Captive Portal (AFAIK) exclusive to FreeBSD meant to
compete with the likes of NoCat. It was sucessfully adopted by various free
Wi-Fi communities and universities running wireless routers on FreeBSD.

Code here is just for history/demonstration purposes.
