CHANGELOG

  - 0.3-devel (10/15/03)

  * Added SIGTERM signal handling for a proper cleanup
  * Added new IPFW2 set grouping capabilities
  * New value entries in splash.cfg file
  * Now using absolute path for the splash.cfg file import in core program, thus
    fixing the problem with boot and rc.d startup cases. Path must be edited manually
    for now if different from default install
 
  - 0.2e (4/23/03)

  * Check if we are successfully running ipfw before the install
  * Fixed the `pid not found' error when running the startup script
  * Fixed when Apache didn't start at boot up
  * Fixed an IP duplicate check, made it more precise to only match
    the `whole-word' IP addresses
  * Placed configuration variables in a separate file splash.cfg
  * General code restructure and use of subroutines, preparation for ipfw2

  - 0.2f (4/20/03)

  * Initially check for existance of the DB file before we actually open the hash file 
    This caused ipfw to add a bogus rule if file didn't exist at startup
  * Move the rule counter and sleep timer, so that we can correctly decrement

  - 0.2 (4/19/03)

  * Use Perl instead of PHP for the HTML form
  * Use NDBM_File (hash) instead of the DB_File (btree)

  - 0.1 (4/17/03)

  * Initial alpha release
