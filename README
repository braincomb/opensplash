How to install?
--

You have to be root to install OpenSplash, since it installs
files that need super-user permissions. To install, just type:

	make install

This will ask you several questions regarding the locations and
then will automatically do the setup for you.

What files to edit?                                              
--

The splash.cfg file contains settings that need to be edited.
Also edit the supplied Apache configuration file. Specify
which IP it should listen to. Defalt port is 8080. If you have
changed the installation directory, change the htdocs in Apache
file too.


--
How to start?
--

A startup script is copied into /usr/local/etc/rc.d. Just type:

	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/opensplash.sh start

This will start both the daemon and Apache tied to our 
configuration file.

How to enable ipfw?
--

NOTE, starting from version 0.3 only IPFW2 is supported, 4-STABLE
users will need to enable IPFW2 support in the kernel, in 5.x IPFW2
is used by default so no worries.

ipfw can be either statically compiled or dynamically loaded.
Add these options in your kernel config file and recompile:

	options IPFIREWALL
	options IPFW2 # (4-STABLE only)
	options IPFIREWALL_FORWARD # transparent proxy support
	options DUMMYNET # for bandwidth throttling (future versions)

In addition, add this line to /etc/rc.conf:

	firewall_enable="YES"

Alternatively, you can load ipfw dynamically, type this as root:

	kldload ipfw
